First entry, and the start of my journal

9/6/25 - Apparently a new issue was found in a grading script because my code would not pass graders for some reason. Glad Jeff and Curtis helped me to figure it out! Starting to get much more comfortable with git and c++. I have been doing a lot of code wars in c++ to help me with syntax and how to use things within the language. Also had to change a few things just barley with my git so that helped me understand things a lot more.

9/16/25 - Entry for last week because I completley forgot. I've been playing with flask and have really enjoyed it and its bin fun to see what simple stuff I can do with it. Been much better with c++ and will probably start making my own projects with it soon. Test is coming up so hopefully I can do well on that.
